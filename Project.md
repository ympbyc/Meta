Ultimate Goal
-------------

### Reveal the Secrets of the Universe ###

*See ympbyc/Meta/Meta.md*

+ Is it a cell
  + of a living creature?
  + of a static object?
+ Is it a simulation?
  + Is it implemented
    - using functional paradigm?
    - using OOP?
+ How can we simulate or create a universe?

Long Term Goals
---------------

### Packet a man ###

+ Make digital copies of me and send them to space

### Create personal flying vehicle ###

+ As accessible as motorcycle
+ Idealy human-powered (almost impossible)

Short Term Goals
----------------

### Create actor-based paradigm ###

*See ympbyc/Nadeko* for proto

+ Messaging
+ Immutable objects
  + Objects are hashs, just like Javascript
+ `__proto__` delegation
+ Methods are all asynchronous
+ Dynamically typed
+ More than almost purely functional
+ S-expression ?
+ Reserved-word-less programming
+ Lazy evaluation

### Formulate Higher-order Applications ###

*See ympbyc/Pasta*

+ If there are multiple functions doing a similar thing, you should abstract them using a higher-order function
+ If there are multiple applications doing a similar thing you should abstract them using a higher-order application. The current interim answer is frameworks but we can do it better
